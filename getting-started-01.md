# Getting Started with Home Assistant

The easiest way to get started with Home Assistant is using the [Home
Assistant Blue][blue], a hardware platform running the Home Assistant
Operating System. In lieu of that, four installation methods are available
that are hardware-independent.

## Software installation methods

HA offers four different isntallation methods. They recommend using one of the
first two, while the latter two are presented as alternative methods for
*experienced users*.

- **HA Operating System**: Minimal Linux OS optimized for HA. Comes with
Supervisor to manage HA Core and pre-installed add-ons.

- **HA Container**: Standalone container-based HA Core (e.g. with Docker).

- **HA Supervised**: Manual installation of the Supervisor.

- **HA Core**: Manual installation using Python virtual environment.

HA recommends a dedicated system to run HA, suggesting a Raspberry Pi with the
HA OS as a good start. For more info, see the [installation
docs][install-docs].
